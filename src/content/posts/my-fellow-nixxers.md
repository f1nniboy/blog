I have been planning on creating a blog for myself for a long time.
I like sharing my knowledge, and as I recently started using NixOS and focusing on declarative deployments, I thought it would be a great idea to create this minimalist echo chamber for myself.

# The Backend
Off-the-shelf blogging solutions like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) always seemed overcomplicated and bloated to me.
While on the search for simple alternatives, I discovered a new static generator I've never heard of before: [Zola](https://www.getzola.org).

I decided to try it out & quickly got accustomed to it. This site is fully managed using my [NixOS dotfiles](https://github.com/f1nniboy/dots), which makes it a breeze to re-build the blog and statically serve it on my VPS.

# What's To Come?
I have pretty much just started to learn Nix and its beauty (*what beauty?*) and wish to use this blog as knowledge database on NixOS, technlogy and other topics I may ramble about in the future.
