i have been planning on creating a blog for myself for a pretty long time. i like sharing my knowledge and random stuff i discover. as i recently started using NixOS, i thought now would be a great time to build this small echo chamber for myself.

# the backend
this blog is being generated by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org), a (to me) new static generator. it's pretty neat and, of course, **blazingly fast**[^1] 🚀🚀🚀. everything is fully managed using [NixOS](https://github.com/f1nniboy/dots), which makes it actually kind of fun to write posts and manage this blog. then, to let you see this page, i use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) as my web server, running on a cheap [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com) VPS.

[^1]: yes, that's one of the first things mentioned on their site. why are rust devs like this?

# what's to come?
i have pretty much just started my journey of learning nixos and getting to know its "*beauty*". i'll probably use this blog as a place to vent or share random bits of knowledge in the future, who knows.
