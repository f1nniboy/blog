I recently decided to delve into the world of ***crypto-currencies***, especially privacy-preserving ones. Not as a get-rich-quick scheme by trading away my life savings, but to use it as a store of currency and to pay for stuff online.

# Well... Which One?
There is an abundance of crypto-currencies in the world, not even counting shitcoins. As specified, I want to use one **a)** as a store of currency and **b)** to preserve my privacy when doing transactions online. Considering that Bitcoin, the most popular one, is actively being endorsed by governments, we can safely cross `privacy-preserving` off that list.

The first result for `privacy crypto coin` on your favorite search engine results in... **Monero**, which is what I decided to get into.

# To KYC, or Not to KYC?
**Monero** is one of the most heavily regulated crypto-currencies, which makes it hard to find a service that exchanges it from fiat currency. In this post I will share my opionated beginner-friendly way of purchasing XMR, skipping over P2P exchange services such as [RetoSwap](https://retoswap.com), *for now*.

# Step-by-Step Guide
## 1. Purchase LTC
1. Go to [LetsExchange.io](https://letsexchange.io/buy) and select LTC as the crypto-currency to receive.
2. Create a temporary LTC wallet using [Cake Wallet](https://cakewallet.com).
3. Choose your payment method of choice.
4. Wait for your funds to arrive in Cake Wallet.

{{ alert(type="tip", text="**Google Pay** is the least likely to result in KYC<sup>[*citation needed*]</sup>, but using it will let Google link your crypto purchase with your account.") }}

## 2. Swap LTC to XMR
1. Go to [Trocador.app](https://trocador.app).
2. Select **LTC** as the crypto-currency to send & **XMR** as the one to receive.
3. Specify to send your full LTC balance to exchange.
4. Specify your XMR address to receive the exchanged funds.

{{ alert(type="tip", text="Make use of **[sub-addresses](https://docs.getmonero.org/public-address/subaddress)** or create a new temporary wallet to receive the funds, to prevent services from linking your purchase with your wallet.") }}

And you're done: have fun with your ~~***CRIMINAL MONEY***~~!
