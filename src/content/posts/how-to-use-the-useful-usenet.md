> **Usenet**, a portmanteau of User's Network, is a worldwide distributed discussion system available on computers. It was developed from the general-purpose Unix-to-Unix Copy dial-up network architecture.

The Usenet was originally a place for online discussions and occasional file-sharing, like a forum or message board. I unfortunately did not partake in this experience, as the concept of Usenet was established in the **1980s**. Nowadays, it's primarily used by **scene groups**[^1] to share pirated movies & shows.

# Why?
Partaking in the Usenet was not really a choice for me. Like everyone else, when I first started getting into media *borrowing* and streaming using **Jellyfin**, I tried using **Torrents** as my main source of media. But as I quickly discovered, movies and shows in my native language were virtually nonexistent on public trackers — and every private tracker required an invite just to get in.

# Services of Choice
## The Indexer
Usenet articles, by themselves, are very much useless. Almost all movies & shows come in separated, encrypted blobs (*articles*) with no metadata. The indexer is responsible for collecting these blobs, giving you the password to decrypt them & some metadata so you actually know what you're getting.

Considering my criteria of
- Not invite-only
- My language having first-class support

I discovered **[SceneNZBs](https://scenenzbs.com)**. For **15€/y**, it provides reasonable API limits and I haven't had any complaints so far. As a bonus: if you use **XMR** to pay for your "donation"<sup>:wink:</sup>, you get **460 days** of membership instead of just a year.

{{ alert(type="tip", text="If you want to figure out how to purchase XMR, you have to [look no further](@/posts/how-to-buy-crypto-online-fast.md).") }}

## The Provider
Simply knowing *where* articles are doesn't help you much: this is where the Usenet provider comes into play. A Usenet provider simply aggregates all these articles, without any metadata or the corresponding passwords. The nature of providers not knowing what data they're storing makes it hard for companies to send DMCA strikes *en masse*.

I opted to use [NewsDemon](https://www.newsdemon.com) as my provider. It goes for a cheap **23.99$/yr** and I haven't amassed any complaints yet.

Just like with **SceneNZBs**, you get a **25% bonus** for paying using XMR.

# Wrap-Up
This post is clearly opinionated: these are far from the only options for comfortably getting into the Usenet. Do your own research before blindly trusting some random recommendations.
