I have been planning on creating a blog for myself for a pretty long time. I like to share my knowledge and random stuff I discover over time. As I recently started out on my journey with NixOS, I thought *now* would be a great time to build this small echo chamber for myself.

# The Backend
This blog is being generated by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org), a (to me) new static generator. It's pretty neat and, of course, **blazingly fast**[^1] :rocket::rocket::rocket:. Everything is fully declaratively managed using [NixOS](https://github.com/f1nniboy/dots). Then, to let you see this page, I use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) as the web server, running on a cheap [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com) VPS.

[^1]: Yes, that's one of the first things mentioned on their site. Why are Rust devs like this?

# What's to Come?
I have pretty much just scratched the surface on NixOS and getting to know its "*beauty*". I'll probably use this blog as a place to vent or share random bits of knowledge in the future.
